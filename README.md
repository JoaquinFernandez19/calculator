# Calculator

Used vanilla Javascript, html and css

## This was my calculator project for TheOdinProject curriculum.


### History

This is not the first attempt or the first one, my previous calculator had a millon bugs, the code was unredeable
and i was lost in my own words, because of that i decided to start focusing on making my code cleaner, as well to think in a more practical way to do this calculator, so i watch a lot of videos, and there was a video that got my attention, it was totally clean
and writted in a way i'd understanded everything, so i start my calculator with that version/video in my head.


It bassically treats the calculator as an object with different methods, this methods are the calculator functions, and each function
correleates to each other, some methods are purely to do simple things, like add a number, other are more complex, for example,
compute the result.

Basically i learn to treat objects in Javascript as real objects, but not forgetting about the most simple functionalities and also had to remember to create the 'memory' of the object, and if the object has a 'display' or something like that, update everytime it is needed.

### Summary

The creation of the program (script) was the next one: 
-First select all elements from the HTML file that i was going to use.
-Create the class Object and pre-think the future methods, and also add the contstructor.
-Start from the basics methods step by step, like displaying a number, store it somewhere, and if the person put more numbers, concatenete them.
-Create eventListener for every input that the user can do.
-This eventListeners will, simply, call the methods from the calculator, and if needed, give them a value to use (numbers for example, when clicked, it runs a method with the argument being the text of the button(current number)).

-And then, create the logic and connections between methods, being this a lot easier because we have a skeleton to work, a skeleton to start using my brain, in the past i started my old calculator in a way that eventListener did all the job, putting fucntions inside them...It could work, but it was nasty and messy.


### Credits

Most of the credits goes to : Web Dev Simplified
I did actually know the fundamentals and follow a path to be able to understand the way he did it, so now i can continue writing cleaner code.

### If you see the javascript file, there is a lot of comments in spanish, my native language, that is because i'm still learning and it helps me remember things better.
